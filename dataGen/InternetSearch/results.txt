Nations, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Thursday, but he
added that this did not make war against Baghdad inevitable.

They are also arguing that British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw
failed to take the time to properly consider their case.

Consequently, the government's image and market confidence would be
called into question if it failed to meet the obligations of the IMF. 

"I forgot to remember to forget," stands in relief on a blue sky laced with
white striations. On the other side "I remembered to forget to remember" floats
in vibrant fuschia, vermillion and orange washes. Amnesia clearly offers the
calmer of the two options.

"They haven't managed to dare to come in and tell me what I am allowed to do and
what I'm not allowed to do," she said last week. "I think I'm strong
enough."

"For more than three years, parliament has failed to meet the obligation it set
for itself," said Klara Sandor of the Alliance of Free Democrats, the junior
party in the Socialist-led coalition.

But then along came the Daiwa case. Daiwa is a very different bank
from BCCI. It was reputable and firmly based in Japan, where, until
this incident, the regulators were considered to be pretty sharp.
Sharp or not, they clearly failed to meet the obligations the Federal
Reserve thought everyone had agreed to.

With all the Easter and Passover and back-from-spring-break
fuss, I'll bet most of you forgot to remember to do what we told
you to do. Namely, go see ``Memento,'' the exceptional movie about
the nature of memory that opened in Atlanta last week. You probably
have another week or so to get there, but if you're homebound, here
are some other movies about the mess a defective memory can cause.

ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The Democrats did their part to
help President Bush and his top political adviser, Karl Rove, win a
victory for Republicans in the elections last week. The Democrats
committed the sin of lifelessness, failing to present voters with
clear political alternatives and leaving a large chunk of their
party's base so unenergized that it failed to turn out to vote. By

The Democrats did their bit by committing the sin of lifelessness,
failing to present voters with clear political alternatives and
leaving a large chunk of their party's base so unenergized that it
failed to turn out to vote.

The coalition that swept him into the White House was absent on
Tuesday night, with evidence that the young, African-American and
first-time voters who supported Obama failed to turn out to help
the Democrats he campaigned for: Gov. Jon S. Corzine in New Jersey
and R. Creigh Deeds in Virginia. (There are no exit polls in the
upstate congressional race to provide demographic information on
the electoral outcome.)
